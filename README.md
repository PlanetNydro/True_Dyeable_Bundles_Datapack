# True Dyeable Bundles Data Pack
True Dyeable Bundles is a data pack that lets you dye bundles the same way you dye armor.

This simple datapack allows you to dye bundles in the same way you would dye leather armor. 

Resource Pack is required. If it is not enabled, all custom dyed bundles will display as normal bundles.

As a side affect from the leather dying system, the normal colored bundle recipes appear to have been overwritten. Adding a normal bundle and a piece of dye to a crafting table will dye it like armor, but you can still use the normal colored bundle recipes if you use the recipe book.

Currently works with version 1.21.4
