# True Dyeable Bundles Datapack

This simple datapack allows you to dye bundles in the same way you would dye leather armor. 

As a side affect of the leather dying system, the normal colored bundle recipes may appear to have been overwritten. Adding a normal bundle and a piece of dye to a crafting table will default to dying it like leather, but you can access the normal colored bundles through the recipe book.

Currently works with version 1.21.11
